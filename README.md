# Timewarp

Move creation and last modified dates of all files in a folder.

## usage
```
timewarp -folder myfolder [-years 1] [-months 1] [-days 1]
```

## ...why?

I recently bought a new camera and took hundreds of pics with it, but they wouldn't show up in my gallery or google photos.
After days of wondering what is wrong, I realized I set my camera's date to 2021 instead of 2022 when setting it up and decided to make this to fix it!

## support

It only works on Macs with Xcode Command Line Tools installed. I'm sorry, there is no universal way of supporting creation dates.
Not like anyone else will use this anyway, just thought it was funny and would share it with the world.
